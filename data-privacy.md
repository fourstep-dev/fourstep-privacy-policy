# What if I want to withdraw from the research study?

If you do consent to participate, you may withdraw at any time. You can do this by closing the questionnaire or uninstalling the Fourstep mobile application from your phone.

If you withdraw from the research, we will destroy any information that has already been collected. If you'd like to withdraw from the research study, please email us at rciti.survey@unsw.edu.au.

Once you have submitted the questionnaire, however, we will not be able to withdraw your responses as the questionnaire is anonymous.

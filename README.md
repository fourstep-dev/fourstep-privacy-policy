# Privacy policy for "Fourstep: Travel Diary"

## Introduction

This app is a custom fork of the e-mission open source platform (https://github.com/e-mission/) intended to support research studies around travel behavior. This privacy policy outlines the data that is collected by the app so that potential participants can make an informed decision on whether to participate in studies using the app.

## Data collected by the app

This app automatically, in the background, tracks your location, accelerometer, device-generated activity recognition and battery usage. It uses this data to automatically generate a travel diary and display it to you. It also allows you to optionally annotate the travel diary with richer details or with experience information. When you launch the app, it logs information about your phone type (android/iOS), make, model and version. This metadata helps the developer to correlate app problems with specific phones (e.g. https://dontkillmyapp.com/).

## Data storage and handling

After you join the study, the app will display a study-specific consent document which will outline study-specific data handling and sharing procedures. Please read it carefully. Background tracking will start only after you accept the consent document. 

## Questions?

If you have any questions about this app please contact the lead developer (Amarin Siripanich, contact -at- fourstep.dev).

## Next steps

If you agree to join the study please complete the on-boarding procedure. If you do not wish to join the study, please uninstall the app.
